# CMinus
C Minus Compiler developed in C with Flex and Bison. Adapted from the Tiny compiler. Generates only AST and symbols table.

This project was originally developed for a Compilers class. It performs lexical, syntatic and semantic analysis, and flags several types of errors.
Currently, it generates the Abstract Syntatic Tree and the symbols table and does not generate code.
